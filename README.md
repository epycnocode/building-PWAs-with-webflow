# Building PWAs with Webflow: Supercharge Your Mobile Experience

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) blur the line between websites and mobile apps, offering offline access, push notifications, and a seamless user experience. Webflow's code-exporting capabilities make building PWAs a breeze. Here's a quick guide with clean code examples:

**1. Essentials for PWAs:**
  - **Web Manifest:** Define your app's name, icon, theme, and offline capabilities.
```
JSON
{
  "name": "My PWA",
  "short_name": "MyPWA",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icon.png",
      "sizes": 192,
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ],
  "theme_color": "#007bff",
  "display": "standalone",
  "start_url": "/"
}

```
- **Service Worker:** Handle offline caching and push notifications using JavaScript.
```
JavaScript
self.addEventListener('install', event => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open('my-pwa-cache')
      .then(cache => cache.addAll(['/index.html', '/assets/main.js']))
  );
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request)
      .then(response => response || fetch(event.request))
  );
});

```

- **Homescreen Installation:** Prompt users to add your PWA to their home screen.
```
JavaScript
if (window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches) {
  console.log('App is in standalone mode');
} else {
  // Show install prompt
}

```

**2. Webflow Integration:**

  - Export Code: Use Webflow's "Export Code" feature to download your project's HTML, CSS, and JS files.
  - Integrate Service Worker: Import your custom service worker script into your exported files.
  - Manifest Configuration: Update the exported Web Manifest with your app's information.
    
3. Deployment and Testing:
  - Host your PWA files on a web server.
  - Use tools like Lighthouse to test your PWA's performance and offline capabilities.
